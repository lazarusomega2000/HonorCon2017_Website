					<div><p>For the first time in over a decade, Star Trek has returned to a weekly episodic format. This time, not on broadcast or cable television, but on a subscription service operated by CBS for American audiences. Now that we have had an opportunity to experience the first few episodes of Star Trek Discovery, as fans,  what are our first impressions? What did they get right? What did they get "wrong"? </p>
					<p>Join Scott Gibson, Chairman of the USS Charon, a chapter of Starfleet International, as we review and discuss the first episodes in the latest incarnation of the Star Trek phenomenon.</p></div>
