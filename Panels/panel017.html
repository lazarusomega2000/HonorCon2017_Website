					<div><p>The North Carolina branch of the Komei Jyuku is focused on the instruction of classic Japanese Samurai combat arts.  Most notably the widely practiced style of iai (sword drawing): "Muso Jikiden Eishin-ryu" meaning "Peerless, Direct Transmission, True-Faith Style." Laying claim to an unbroken history of approximately 450 years. This make it the second oldest extant martial art form in Japan.  The NCKJ will be showing combative drills, sparring, mock combat, and target cutting.  They will also  answer questions (theoretical and historical) about sword parts and assembly.</p></div>
