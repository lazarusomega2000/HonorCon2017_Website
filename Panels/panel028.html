					<div><p>Captain of the List Mike Romero, Captain Junior Grade Thomas McDonald, and Commander Jim Cunningham lead a discussion on how Honor Harrington was inspired by and modeled after heroes from naval fiction, especially C.S. Forester’s Horatio Hornblower.  Using Forester’s “Beat to Quarters/The Happy Return” along with Patrick O’Brian’s “H.M.S. Surprise” as references, we’ll discuss the leadership and personality traits of Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey and how they can be seen reflected in Honor Harrington.  To conclude, we’ll have a theoretical discussion on who might prove victorious in a naval action between Hornblower and Aubrey</p></div>
