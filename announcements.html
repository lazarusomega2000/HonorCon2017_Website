His other series include the Turning Point series, a zombie apocalypse book with a twist. A Time to Die (2016 DragonCon Dragon Award finalist) was released in May 2016, and the soon to be released sequel, A Time to Run. He also has the Earth Song series, five space opera books placed in a future where an orphaned mankind must fight for its very existence in a hostile galaxy. Mark hails out of rural Tennessee and has been creating new worlds since he was old enough to write. With a pretty wide assortment of jobs and travel behind him, he is very well equipped to write some fantastic science fiction. Come and meet him and our other guest authors at HonorCon 2017!</p>

    			<h2>Saving Grace K9s to be Charity for HonorCon 2017</h2>
    			<h3>HC2017 Charity – Saving Grace K9s</h3>
    			<br>
				<p><b>Raleigh, North Carolina, May 15th, 2017</b> – Every year, the staff of HonorCon selects a charity to be the beneficiary of the funds gathered via our charity auction. This year, our collections will be going to Saving Grace K9s, based out of Lexington, North Carolina. Saving Grace K9's is a nonprofit organization that teaches veterans who suffer from PTSD how to train their own service dog, whether it be a dog they already are bonded with or a rescue dog the organization locates for them. Saving Grace K9s provides all their services, training equipment and service dog gear at no cost to the veteran. 22 veterans a day commit suicide, a staggering and unacceptable number of heroes gone. The mission of Saving Grace K9s is to reduce those numbers by providing a four legged lifeline. You can find out more about Saving Grace K9s at <a href="http://savinggracek9s.com" target="_blank">http://savinggracek9s.com</a>.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Like every year, we are asking our Sponsors, Vendors, and convention attendees to donate what they can to help with the charity silent auction as well as contribute to our traditional charity baskets that will be included in the event. In addition, we are asking for members with chapters of the TRMN attending to work up a basket to be included in the silent auction that will go on during the weekend, and have that basket mirror the personality of the Chapter. All members of the TRMN are welcome to participate, be they RMN, RMMC, RMA, GSN, IAN, or the Civilian service and Merchant Marine. This challenge also goes out to the attending fan organizations that are coming with fan tables, show your fandoms colors in this project also, get a basket together and have it tossed in, be you a member of SFI, CMoD, a SCAidan, Whovian or the newly formed NAC! Take a few moments and show your chapter’s personality, we saw some truly amazing ones at last year. Don’t forget, just because members of your chapter might not be able to make it to the convention, it is still possible to coordinate to have a charity basket to represent your group!</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>We look forward to this event and can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with and, once again, are proud to be supporting Saving Grace K9s as our charity this year!</p>

    			<h2>Larry Corriea to Join in Celebrating HonorCon 2017</h2>
    			<h3>Larry Corriea, Guest HC2017</h3>
    			<br>
				<p><b>Raleigh, North Carolina, April 1st, 2017</b> – Please join us in giving a warm welcome to Larry Corriea as we add him to our fantastic lineup of amazing literary guests. This year that lineup includes such awesome military science fiction writers as Marko Kloos, Chris Kennedy and of course, David Weber. Many of you may recognize Larry from his Monster Hunter International books, as well as the Dead Six novels with his co-author Mike Kupari. Larry is “hopelessly addicted to two things, guns and B-horror movies” and it shows in the amount of firearms-related detail in his work. Correia's works tend to include monsters such as vampires, werewolves, etc., as well as containing strong magical themes.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Correia’s first novel, Monster Hunter International, made the Entertainment Weekly bestseller list in 2008, and when re-released under Baen, was on the Locus bestseller list in 2009. Each sequel in the Monster Hunter International series has made the New York Times bestseller list as well. Correia was a finalist for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2011. Warbound, the third book in Correia's The Grimnoir Chronicles series, received a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2014. Needless to say, we are incredibly honored to have Larry Corriea join the HonorCon family of science fiction authors. </p>
