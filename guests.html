										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>David Mark Weber is an American science fiction and fantasy author.  He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1952. He started writing poetry and short fiction in the fifth grade, and a lifetime of reading, writing, and studying has given him a love of storytelling that clearly shows in his work. In his stories, he creates a consistent and rationally explained technology and society. Even when dealing with fantasy themes, the magical powers are treated like another technology with supporting rational laws and principles.</p>
											<p>Many of his stories have military, and particularly naval, themes, and fit into the military science fiction genre. He challenges current gender roles in the military by assuming that a gender-neutral military service will exist in his futures. By frequently placing female leading characters in what have previously been seen as traditionally male roles, he has explored the challenges faced by women in the military and politics.</p>
											<p>His most popular and enduring character is Honor Harrington, whose story, together with the "Honorverse" she inhabits, has been developed through nineteen novels, six shared-universe anthologies, a three book young-adult series, and “Honorverse historical” Manticore Ascendant series, written with Timothy Zahn and Tom Pope. To date, David currently has seventy two book titles and twenty one separete series that he has written or co-written.</p>
											<p>David currently lives in Greenville, SC with his wife Sharon, their three children, three dogs and four cats. You can keep up with David's busy schedule by following his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/david.weber.5621" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>, <a href="http://www.davidweber.net/" target="_blank">davidweber.net</a> and on Twitter. His works can be purchased at his official on-line store at <a href="http://www.weberuniversaloutfitters.com" target="_blank">http://www.weberuniversaloutfitters.com</a> and through his store's Facebook page of Weber Universal Outfitters.</p>

											<h3 class="modal-title">Mark Wandrey</h3>
										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>Located in rural Tennessee, Mark Wandrey has been creating new worlds since he was old enough to write. After penning countless short stories, he realized novels were his real calling and hasn't looked back since. A lifetime of diverse jobs, extensive world travels, and living in most areas of the United States have uniquely equipped him with experiences to color his stories in ways many find engaging and thought provoking. His books include the Earth Song series, five books placed in a future where an orphaned mankind must fight for its very existence in a hostile galaxy. A sixth book is in development.</p>
											<p>His current work is the Four Horsemen Universe, centering around Cartwright's Cavaliers (released 12/2016), and coming soon Winged Hussars (to be released 7/2017). The Four Horsemen Universe, 4HU, is full of aliens, mercenaries, and adventure. Placed just a hundred years in the future, humanity finds itself part of a Galactic Union filled with thousands of races, and the only thing we have of value to trade is our time honed ability to kick butt.</p>
											<p>Another of his works is the Turning Point series, a zombie apocalypse book with a twist. A Time to Die (2016 DragonCon Dragon Award finalist) was released in May 2016, and the sequel, A Time to Run, to be released 2017.</p>

										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>These magical masters of musical hi-jinx and mayhem will wizard rock the tea towel right off your house elf. Their unique blend of 80s new wave, 50s do-wop, straight up pop rock and old-timey sing-songy comedy will leave you laughing and crying for more. They draw inspiration from the Harry Potter series, Dr Who, the SCA, medieval fantasy, science fiction and all kinds of delightfully, geeky fandomness.</p>
											<p>Scott & Kirsten Vaughan began performing together in 1992 in the SCA, where they are known as Master Efenwealt Wystle and Maîtresse Aénor d’Anjou. Upon the release of Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows in 2007, and after encountering bands like Draco & the Malfoys, The Mudbloods, and The Moaning Myrtles they decided to form their own wizard rock act. Since then they have performed at conventions, libraries, bars, living rooms and wizard rock festivals all over the eastern US and even in London, UK. They live in Cary, NC (under the name Sanderz) with two kids and a cat named Rosemerta. (That’s the cat’s name. It would just be silly to give both our kids the same name as the cat!)</p>
											<p>When not out conquering the galaxy with her army of robotic wallabies, Kirsten creates steampunk/medieval/fantasy accessories for her online store (<a href="http://myfunkycamelot.etsy.com/" target="_blank">MyFunkyCamelot.etsy.com</a>). In order to protect his secret past as a renegade HVAC engineer, Scott pretends to manage communications campaigns for clinical research studies at a small advertising/creative services agency. Chuck Parker of Richmond, VA usually joins them on bass. He claims to be a mild-mannered government IT contracts coordinator, but we suspect he’s really a super spy.</p>
